            <span class="p"><h2>Message from the Creators:</h2>When we were planning this game, we wanted to disrupt the spread of misinformation about contemporary social issues. Despite the benefits of the internet, which grants a vast majority of people in Calgary with immediate access to information, numerous irreputable sources or misleading reports are taken at face value as fact with no further insight. We’ve seen this issue sprout in a variety of different fields (like Homelessness, Anxiety, and Depression) and sought out a solution that could affect the same people affected by misinformation. Thus, we created this game and website to help spread awareness about how these issues truly are present in our community of Calgary. Our hope is that by playing the game, finding the facts, and choosing reasonable solutions that you will not only understand how widespread misinformation is, but also learn the undeniable truth of each of these issues.<br>
            <br>If our game has garnered a yearning within you to contribute to aiding those affected by these social issues, please look at the Charity of the Month to donate or learn more about how to help.
            <h2>About the Game:</h2>This game aims to lead you, the player, towards finding the truth amongst the voices, but only by collecting the JackFacts can you find the best end for your population (Calgary). For every level, your choice can both severely and insignificantly affect your population through sickness, total population, health, unhappiness, public safety, and a variety of other factors. But beware, you may only see a JackFact once, so remember what you are told, and uncover the truth amongst the lies.<br>
            <br>JackFacts is a side-scrolling, 16-bit videogame where you take control of a generic person who is designated as the leader of your population. There are multiple outcomes for each level indicated by the many doors hidden in the level, however, only the first outcome for your population will have an affect on how your population thrives or delves into despair.

            <span class="p"><h2>How to Play:</h2>Since there is no introduction, there are two different ways to play JackFacts. The first one is for laptops or computers with keyboards, the second is for mobile devices or playing on touchscreen device.
            <h4>For Computer Players:</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Move your character around by using the arrow keys to jump and move side-to-side. You can move diagonally upwards by pressing the side arrow (left or right, depending on which direction you want to move in) and up arrow together.</li>
            <li>The left shift button toggles the sprint option in game, allowing you to jump further and move faster. You do not need to hold shift while moving, as pressing it will turn sprint on indefinitely (until you press shift again).</li>
            <li>When you reach a JackFact, you can interact with it by moving into it, which then automatically “collects” it. You can alternatively avoid the JackFacts by jumping over them.</li>
            <li>To reach an end, you must find the door that you wish to choose and simply left-click on it with your mouse or click on the trackpad.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>For Touchscreen or Mobile Players</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Move your character around by moving the analog stick displayed on the left-hand side of the screen. Your character will move in any direction that the analog stick is pointed.</li>
            <li>When you reach a JackFact, you can interact with it by moving into it, which then automatically “collects” it. You can alternatively avoid the JackFacts by jumping over them.</li>
            <li>By pressing the ‘C’ button on screen, you can toggle your sprint on and off, allowing you to move faster and jump further. To turn off sprint, simply press the ‘C’ button once more.</li>
            <li>When you approach a door, press the ‘A’ button to interact with it, allowing you to finish the level and see the outcome you have chosen.</li>
            <li>As a bonus option, pressing the ‘B’ button will allow your character to jump, if you do not wish to use the analog stick to do so. (Analog stick will still make your character jump if it is pointed upwards in any direction.)</li>
            </ol>
